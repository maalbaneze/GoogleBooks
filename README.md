# GoogleBooks
HW #15

This assignemnt was different in that we were given a functioning React app that used a MongoDB for recording user inputs and an API call with Axios for data (Google Books).

Our assignement was to review all the files within the app and comment as to their purpose/functionality.  The valiue in this was to force the student to comprehend how the files worked with each other (imports and exports) and how React renders the web pages via their elements.

Commenting within the React Render DOM manipulator was problematic as it would break the code, so comments for those areas are below it.
